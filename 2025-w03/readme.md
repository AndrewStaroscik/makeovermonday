# Makeover Monday 2025 Week 3 - 100 most popular games on Steam

## Overview

This is information provided by [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed) - data used is available [here](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2025w3-steam-top-100-played-games)

## Chart Description

I decided to make a network diagram to view similarities between games based on each games list of genre tags. 

A simple network diagram turned out to be too messy as most games share multiple tags. 

To simplify the data, I created a similarity matrix based on shared tags and created links between each game in the database and the three most similar games (based on shared genre tags).
