# Makeover Monday 2025 Week 1 - HPV Vaccination Rates

## Overview

Country level HPV vaccination rates over time from a November 2024 report by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer)

## Chart Description

This five-panel chart groups country-level vaccination rates based on how they changed over time.

The patterns identified are: 
- high rates with little change
- increasing rates
- moderate rates with little change
- decreasing rates
- low rates with little change 

Within each of these groupings, additional patterns emerge: rates remain flat in some countries while showing high variability in others. During COVID, rates dropped in some countries but remained unchanged in others. 

For this chart I decided to highlight each countries vaccination rates (high, intermediate or low) in the latest year: 2022.


## Design Challenges

* There is a lot of data (multiple years of data from over 160 countries)
* the data is highly variable
* the table is sparse (time series start at different years for different countries)
* the charts in the original source are presented with little context. Sense making is left to the viewer. 

Ideally this type of data would undergo some more focused analysis to try to pull out some meaningful patterns and insights. 

The challenge I set for myself with this design was to retain as much data as possible while highlighting patterns and relationships that might merit further investigation.

This multi-panel chart is the result
